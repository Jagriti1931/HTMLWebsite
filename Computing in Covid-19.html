    <h1>Computing's Contribution to Dealing with Covid-19</h1>

    <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/032420_mt_computer-covid_feat-1028x579.jpg" alt="Computer Science during Covid-19" width=40%>

    <h2>Scientific Research</h2>

    <p>
      A field of Computer Science that is massively helping us cope with Covid-19 is AI (Artificial Intelligence). AI is being used to help predict graphs which show the spread of the virus, as well as the speed at which the virus is spread.
      This is important for tracking Covid-19 to reduce the rate of spread by contact tracing. AI-based diagnostics can also be applied for diagnosing Covid-19 infections much quicker and more reliably.
      As well as this, Computer Science is used to map the genetic evolution of the virus, which allows us to know more about the virus, helping the search for a vaccine.
    </p>

    <h2>Social Life</h2>

    <p>
      Most people have been relying on some applications of Computer Science to cope with being locked down during the pandemic. Applications such as the internet have been beneficial for connecting with other people while stuck at home through phone calls, video calls and text messages.
      Being stuck at home means that people have also been finding other forms of entertainment from home: such as streaming movies and TV shows, playing video games or keeping up with other people through social media.
    </p>

    <h2>Impacts on General Life</h2>

    <p>
      The pandemic has meant that many people now have to work from home, which is made possible by the contributions of Computer Science. Remote working can be done through video conferencing and the ability to share files with cloud computing, or over the internet.
      Some applications of Computer Science are important for tracking the changes in transport and food supplies, for example, which were heavily impacted by Covid-19. By monitoring the changes, supplies are able to be readily adjusted to fit the demand, which varies for places where the severity of the virus differs.
      Finally, due to social media, the internet, and live television, any changes in the advice with regards to Covid-19 can be communicated and spread efficiently to reach as many people as possible in a short amount of time.
