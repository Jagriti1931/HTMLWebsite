    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p> The evolution of computing has greatly impacted and benefitted medical professions and workplaces in a variety of ways. 

        For example, vast quantities of medical data, such as prescriptions and the medical history of a patient, can now be stored
        electronically. This means that medical professionals can efficiently search and find the information they need regarding a
        patient.
    </p>

    <h2> Medical Technologies: </h2>

    <p> Computing has also influenced the technological side of medicine. Many pieces of medical equipment (e.g. X-ray machines) 
        run using pre-programmed instructions, which has increased the quality and efficiency of care.
        As well as this, scientists have been able to research diseases on a cellular level which has led to them being able to produce
        anti-bodies and therefore vaccines against them.
     </p>

     <h2> Medical Communication: </h2>

     <p> Computing also enables doctors to collaborate over the internet, which can quickly provide them with a second opinion.
       As well as this, doctors can easily communicate with their patients should they need to be contacted. Large databases, as well
       as medical journals, can also be found and accessed almost instantly online. This has enabled doctors to quickly check their 
       diagnoses and correctly inform their patients.
